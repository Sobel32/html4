	After my military service i went on a 4 month trip .
	I started in Peru, visited Cusco where i did some hiking, rented a motorcycle for a week and traveled with it along the roads,  and of course visited the Machu Pichu.
	But the main reason for my trip was to surf, so i took a flight to Lima (the capital city of Peru) to buy a surfboard. I found a nice surfboard shop of a local brand called "Klimax"
	I spent there over two hours, amazed by the different surfboards and equipment. The store manager was very nice abd gave us a tour in the the surfboard production department and it was really cool!

Here is the route I took on the surfing trip:
</br>
<ol>
  <li>Mancora, Peru- a very small surfing village in northwestern Peru.</li>
  <li>Montanita,Ecuador stayed there for two weeks</li>
  <li>Santa Teresa,Costa Rica- small fishing and surfing town</li>
  <li>El Tunco, El- Salvador- one of the most dangerous country in the world but i stayed only at El Tunco which is a safe and beautifull surfing village</li>

</ol>
I surfed 2 sometimes 3 sessions a day, each session about 2 hours so it was very exhausting but i enjoyed every second. In the rest of the time I enjoyed good local restoraunts,bars and just relaxing.
After that big trip i went for two weeks in Arugam bay Sri Lanka - another surfing village.
My last trip was to Puerto Escondido - Mexico. Each trip teaches me more about surfing, the ocean and fills me with good energy.
